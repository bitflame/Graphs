rithms of Chapter 1. The constructor can build a UF object, do a union() operation
for each of the graphâ€™s edges, and implement marked(v) by calling connected(s, v).
Implementing count() requires using a weighted UF implementation and extending
its API to use a count() method that returns wt[find(v)] (see Exercise 4.1.8). But it looks like
count is working without implementing the weighted UF. If I wanted to identify each component with
its root, then I believe I have to use Weighted Union Find. todo: See if you can print out the nodes in
each component */
